Removing output files of failed job genome_generation since they might be corrupted:
results/full_hybrid_genome_index
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
slurmstepd: error: Detected 1 oom_kill event in StepId=8795705.batch. Some of the step tasks have been OOM Killed.
